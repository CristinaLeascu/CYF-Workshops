Imagine you're speaking to a trainee who is starting at Code Your Future for the first time. 
They ask the following question:

"What is the difference between github.com and Github desktop?"

GitHub.com is a web-based platform for hosting and managing repositories online, while GitHub Desktop is a desktop application that simplifies local Git operations with a graphical user interface.

How would you answer this question in order to help the new trainee?
